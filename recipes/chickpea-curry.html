        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This recipe is great for two reasons, the first being that it is very <em>simple</em> to make 
            and the second being that it is easy to <em>batch cook</em> and freeze for future meals!
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of using individual ingredients for seasoning, curry powder is used for simplicity. 
            Canned chickpeas are used for the same reason. 
            Only onion and spinach are mentioned as vegetable ingredients, <strong>however any vegetables can be 
            added</strong> such as mushrooms or bell pepper. 
        </p>
