        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a simple dish that is easy to <em>batch cook</em> and it is very <em>filling</em> to boot!</p>
        <p>Despite the name this is not a risotto but a kind of beef curry. Anyway risotto sounds more fancy and more importantly, with only 7 ingredients and two vegetables to chop, this is <strong>easy to make in a pinch</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Serves 4</p>
        <ul>
            <li>500g Beef Mince</li>
            <li>1 Onion</li>
            <li>Garlic Granules</li>
            <li>Pack of Mushrooms</li>
            <li>Spice Paste (2-4 tbsp)</li>
            <li>1 Beef Stock Cube</li>
            <li>Rice (1/2 cup per serving)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>25 minutes</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat up a large pan and put the kettle on for the rice (leave some water for the other pan later). Oil is optional as the mince may have enough juices</li>
            <li>Put the required amount of rice and double the amount of boiled water in a covered saucepan on medium-low heat. Check back occasionally as the rice is finished when the water has boiled away</li>
            <li>Chop the onion into small chunks</li>
            <li>Put the mince in the large pan, stirring frequently and breaking down the mince, and cook until browned</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, wash and chop the mushrooms into thin slices</li>
            <li>Once the mince has browned, add the onion</li>
            <li>When the mushrooms are prepared add them to the pan and heat until they reduce down a bit</li>
            <li>Pour a little of the remaining water from the kettle into the large pan along with the beef stock cube, the spice paste, and the garlic granules</li>
            <li>Heat until most of the water disappears, then add salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Serve the rice on a plate or shallow bowl and stir in a few scoops of the sauce</li>
        </ol>
