        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a simple dish that is easy to <em>batch cook</em> and it is very <em>filling</em> to boot!</p>
        <p>Despite the name this is not a risotto but a kind of beef curry. Anyway risotto sounds more fancy and more importantly, with only 7 ingredients and two vegetables to chop, this is <strong>easy to make in a pinch</strong>.</p>
